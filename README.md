###Owin.Examples

This repo contains my understanding of two different approaches to middleware. Through my [blogpost](http://blog.csainty.com/2013/12/owin-am-i-missing-something.html) and on twitter recently I have expressed disagreement with what appears to be the majority held belief for how middleware should be written and then composed into pipelines.

###I'm probably wrong...

I want to stress that I am honestly and open-mindedly investigating and assessing different opinions. Since writing the blogpost I have read, and re-read the current discussions on [GitHub](https://github.com/owin/owin/issues?state=open) and tried my best to understand different points of view.

###Let me know...
Want to tell me how wrong I am? Want to show me a better way? 
Tweet me [@csainty](http://twitter.com/csainty), make an issue against this repo or send me a pull request.

### Yeah but what about...
Finally if you want to add another constraint to applications constructed in this repo, one you think can make a point for or against either approach. Then please let me know. It is far too easy to cherry-pick the examples that prove your own point and I don't want to do that here.
